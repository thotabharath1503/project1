# HR Analytics - Employee Attrition Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data using Power BI and Jupyter Notebook. The primary goal is to identify patterns and trends in employee turnover to help organizations improve retention strategies.

##  Dataset

* **Filename**: Cleaned\_HR\_Analytics\_Dataset.csv
* **Size**: 1000 rows (after data cleaning)
* **Columns**: Includes Employee ID, Department, Job Role, Gender, Education Level, Attrition, and more.

##  Data Cleaning Steps

1. Removed duplicate rows.
2. Dropped rows with missing Employee IDs.
3. Standardized column names for consistency.
4. Saved cleaned data to **Cleaned\_HR\_Analytics\_Dataset.csv**.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

* **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning.
* **Power BI** for data visualization and analysis.
* **GitHub** for version control.

##  Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Power BI Visuals

* Donut Chart (Attrition Distribution by Department)
* Stacked Column Chart (Attrition by Department and Gender)
* Matrix (Attrition by Job Role and Education Level)

##  Future Improvements

* Advanced data preprocessing (e.g., handling outliers).
* Adding machine learning for attrition prediction.
